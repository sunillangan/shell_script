#Service Status Monitoring Script: Develop a script to monitor the status of critical services and take actions if they are down. Example Code: 
#!/bin/bash 
services=("apache2" "mysql" "ssh") 
for service in "${services[@]}"; do 
    if systemctl is-active --quiet "$service"; 
    then 
         echo "Service $service is running" 
    else 
         echo "Service $service is not running" 

# Restart service or send alert here 
    fi 
done
